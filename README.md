# madlibs-showdown
Madlibs is a fun game to play with friends where each person picks a random set of words that is used to fill out a random story. 
Looking at the market, I didn't see many quality web-based versions of this fun game. 
So I decided to build one using Django.
I have already built a console-based version of the game with python and mySQL, which you can check out [here](https://github.com/DejunJackson/Madlibs).
This game will feature authentication, single player mode, multiplayer mode, a leaderboard, and a place to check game history.
